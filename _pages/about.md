<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

[cite_start]I am a final-year undergraduate student pursuing a dual degree in Communication Engineering from Xidian University and Heriot-Watt University.  [cite_start]I have strong hands-on experience in developing, evaluating, and training MLLM-based GUI Agents.  [cite_start]My primary research interest lies in GUI Agent Training, and I am also enthusiastic about exploring related fields such as Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models (including GRPO and DPO), LLM reasoning, and ToolUse Agents.  [cite_start]I am actively seeking a research intern position where I can apply and further develop my expertise in these areas while contributing to a research team.

[**Project**](https://example.com/link_to_project_page)
- [cite_start]As the lead for AppEvalPilot, I designed and implemented a system to dynamically assess software functionality through UI interaction, moving beyond the limitations of static analysis for LLM-based software engineers. 
- [cite_start]My work involved creating automated test case generation and a test execution agent capable of complex GUI interactions. 
- [cite_start]The experimental results demonstrated a high correlation (0.91) between AppEvalPilot's assessments and those of human experts, while also being 55% faster and 94.8% cheaper.

# üöÄ Projects
- **OSAgent: Cross-platform Intelligent Assistant** (Sep. 2024 - May. 2025)
  - [cite_start]Focused on developing a universal, stable, and efficient GUI agent framework. 
  - [cite_start]Contributed to the architecture design, perception, planning, and execution modules. 
  - [cite_start]Achieved state-of-the-art performance on SpaBench (mobile) cross-application tasks (26.7% vs. 13.3% by the previous SOTA). 
- **R1-Like GUI Agent Training** (Apr. 2024 - May. 2025)
  - [cite_start]Focused on enhancing the core element grounding capability of GUI agents using GRPO. 
  - [cite_start]Designed a data collection and refinement pipeline and a multi-component reward function. 
  - [cite_start]Demonstrated that 1k meticulously selected data points can achieve performance comparable to SOTA models trained on millions of samples, significantly improving GUI grounding accuracy on benchmarks like ScreenSpot and ScreenSpotPro.
